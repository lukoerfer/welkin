# Welkin
[Welkin](http://simile.mit.edu/welkin/) is a graph-based RDF visualizer, developed in the context of the [SIMILE](http://simile.mit.edu/) project at MIT.
The project was abandoned, but Welkin can still be pretty useful when working with RDF data.
Since Welkin was published as open source, I decided to fork the existing repository to let it live on GitHub.
Some small changes were applied to the infrastructure, but not to the code itself.
If anyone is interested in working on the tool, feel free to contact me or to simply use this repository.

## Changes

* Pushed into a fresh GIT repository (coming from SVN)
* Ported TODO.txt to GitHub issues
* Introduced Gradle as build tool
* Updated list of dependencies
* Removed functionality related to Java WebStart
* Replaced contents of existing `docs` folder with a PDF version of the former user guide
